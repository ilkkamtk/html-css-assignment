# HTML + CSS Assignment
### Make your version of [the provided layout](assingment-layout.pdf).
* In the provided layout you'll find the plans for three pages: Home, Products and Contact.
* Your task is to make a simple website using the provided layout.
* The result does not have to be pixel-perfect. It's enough that the visual structure is close to the provided layout.
* You can have the three pages in one document, or you can put each page into its own document.
* You should make up your own color palette and choose a font (or fonts) for your version.
* Also add your own images to the page(s).
* You can use lorem ipsum as text content. Any text will do.
* You don't have to consider copyrights, since this is an educational assignment.
* More detailed description in the video provided in Oma.
* Web page(s) don't need to be responsive.

### How to submit:

See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7mjd5Vi6lk&list=PLKenVLUxjmH-y89AiiI2xcXDy5QG83D4K&index=6) for details. Example submission:

### Evaluation
On submission, you will automatically receive grade 5. If some aspects of the assignment are missing or inadequate, grade will be deducted as follows:
* Your version does not resemble the provided layout, or CSS is missing -1 to -3
* Navigation does not work -3
* Images are not found -3
* Contrast check is not passed -2
   * _UPDATE 28.10.2024_: https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/ is no longer available. Use https://wave.webaim.org/ instead. [Example screenshot here](wave.png).
   * Contrast errors needs to be 0. Other items are checked with validation and Lighthouse below. 
* Validation is not passed -3
   * No errors
   * Warnings, like no heading in `<article>` or `<section>` etc. are allowed
* Lighthouse check score is less than 90 -1, less than 70 -2
  * some versions of Chrome show the score with 5/5 or 4/4 in that case -1 from each missing point. E.g. 3/4 = -1. However, max deduction is -2
  * Update 25.3.2024: If you use `<iframe>` to add Google map, Lighthouse will deduct points. That will not affect evaluation. you should however consider just using an image of the map. 
* Default font (Times New Roman) -2
* Missing padding (text too close to edges or other elements) -2
